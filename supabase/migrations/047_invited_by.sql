-- ============================================================
-- 047 — track who invited whom, scope Gestor's team view to it.
--
-- Master (owner) sees every member/invite in the account. Gestor
-- (admin) and Agente now only see members + invitations THEY
-- personally created — enforced in the API routes
-- (GET /api/account/members, GET /api/account/invitations), not
-- RLS, since it's a "narrow what the client renders" rule rather
-- than a security boundary (a Gestor can already manage-members
-- account-wide; this only limits what they're shown, so scoping in
-- the route keeps the change small and reversible).
--
-- `profiles.invited_by_user_id` is the source of truth, stamped at
-- redeem time from the invitation's `created_by_user_id`. Rows
-- created before this migration (including profiles moved into an
-- account directly, outside the invite flow) stay NULL — visible to
-- Master only, which is the correct default (nobody "invited" them
-- in the tracked sense).
